# Clojure programming with VSpaceCode

VSpaceCode is an extension to VSCode that provides a complete keyboard driven experience, driving not just the text but the whole editor.

A mnemonic menu system on top of the VSCode command pallet is driven by which-key and provides access to a far wider range of commands that VSCode alone.

Practicalli added VSpaceCode key bindings for Calva to provide an effective Clojure workflow.

!!! INFO "Calva key bindings in VSpaceCode"
    VSpaceCode includes Calva key bindings directly via [pull request #154](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/VSpaceCode/pull/154)

## Navigate the book

Use the mouse or built-in key bindings to navigate the pages of the book

- ++p++ , ++comma++ : go to previous page
- ++n++ , ++period++ : go to next page

Use the search box to quickly find a specific topic

- ++f++ , ++s++ , ++slash++ : open search dialog
- ++arrow-down++ , ++arrow-up++ : select next / previous result
- ++esc++ , ++tab++ : close search dialog
- ++enter++ : follow selected result
